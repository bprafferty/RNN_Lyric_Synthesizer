How to run our project:

  1. Make sure all files are in the same directory.

  2. Open generator.py using Spyder IDE (available within the Anaconda download).

  3. Press the play button to compile and run the code.

  4. Training the model should take roughly 1.5 hours to complete, and
        will output 1000 characters when finished.

  5. If you have the ability to run models on your local machine, we have
        include our trained model ledZep.reccurentNetwork
